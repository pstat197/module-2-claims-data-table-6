### HTML scraping

To determine whether header content improves webpage classification, we extended the HTML scraping process to extract not only paragraph text but also header tags (h1–h6). We applied the same cleaning pipeline to both datasets and used logistic principal component regression (LPCR) to compare predictive performance. Each dataset was transformed using TF–IDF, reduced to 50 principal components, and evaluated with an 80/20 stratified train/test split to ensure a fair comparison.

The results indicate that including header text did not improve predictive accuracy. The LPCR model using only paragraph text achieved an accuracy of 0.547, while the model using both paragraphs and headers decreased slightly to 0.531. This suggests that headers, while potentially informative, were often too inconsistent or sparse across webpages to meaningfully enhance classification. Thus, the additional header text may have introduced noise rather than providing useful signal for the binary prediction task, and therefore we can conclude that including header text did not improve predictive accuracy.

### Bigrams

Do bigrams capture additional information relevant to the classification of interest? Answer the question, **briefly** describe what analysis you conducted to arrive at your answer, and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.
